# ville dyr

In the fictional country of Ruritania there are many wild animals. A group of researchers now wants to find out more about how the wild animals in Ruritania live.

programs should be used to keep track of all the information about the marked wild animals and recaptures. 


#### Functions 
* Register New Animal: 
This command should be used when an animal is caught for the first time and therefore does not exist in the register. The program starts by asking what kind of animal it is, and then asking for information about the animal. The program itself must generate an identity for the animal. 

* Record information about recaptured animals: 
The program starts by asking for the animal's identity, and then asks for the animal's recapture information.

* Searching for animals:
The program asks for the animal's identity, and then writes the information about the animal (including the recapture data) if the animal is in the register. 

* Find out how many animals are recaptured each year
The program will ask for the year, and will then ask for how many animals have been recaptured that year

* Find out how many hares
each type (regular hare and sire) registered.

* Create an unsorted report
of all animals in the register, where data for the first catch is included.

* In addition, the program should write data to file and read from file. This should be done by entering automatically when the program starts, and that storage occurs automatically each time a new registration is made.
